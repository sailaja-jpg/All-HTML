1)Father of HTML
WWW.tim Berneis Lie(1995)
2)By using html and css we can build static webpages
3)To convert from static to dynamic we use JS
4)All the browsers understand HTML language hence we run html files in all the different Browsers
5)HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language
i)Hyper Text: SEt of links present in document which will be get hyper to some other places that text is called as Hypertext
 we can provide links on webpage by using HTML
ii)Markup Language: Language which represents data on the webpage by using Markup Tags is called Markup Language
Note:All Formatting tags are inline level elements

Interview Questions on HTML
1)Is HTML is a Case Sensitive?No, HTML is not case-sensitive.

That means you can write HTML tags, attributes, and element names in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case, and they will still work the same way.

✅ Example – all of these are valid:

<html>
<HEAD>
<Title>My Page</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
</BODY>
</html>


However, the best practice is to write HTML tags and attributes in lowercase, especially when using XHTML or working with modern HTML5, because it improves readability and consistency.
2)What is HTML?Why HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is the standard language used to create and design web pages.
HTML defines the structure and layout of a webpage using a set of tags (called elements).
🧩 In simple words:
HTML tells the web browser what to display — for example, text, images, links, tables, forms, etc.
✅ Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>


💡 Why HTML? (Importance of HTML)
Here’s why HTML is important and widely used:


🌍 Foundation of Web Pages – Every website you visit is built using HTML as its basic structure.


🧱 Defines Structure – It organizes content like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.


🎨 Works with CSS & JavaScript – HTML structures the page, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.


⚙️ Platform Independent – HTML works on all browsers and devices.


📄 Easy to Learn – Simple syntax makes it beginner-friendly.



🏁 In summary:

HTML = Language that gives structure to web pages.
Why HTML? = Because it is the foundation of the web, making it possible to display and organize content in browsers.
    

3)how to link two web pages?   
To link two web pages, we use the <a> tag (called the anchor tag).
The anchor tag creates hyperlinks — clickable text or images that take users from one page to another.

✅ Example: Linking Two Web Pages
Suppose you have two files:


index.html (Home Page)


about.html (About Page)


Here’s how you can link them:
index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Home Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>Click below to learn more about us:</p>
  <a href="about.html">Go to About Page</a>
</body>
</html>

about.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>About Us</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>About Our Website</h1>
  <p>This page contains information about our site.</p>
  <a href="index.html">Back to Home</a>
</body>
</html>


💡 Explanation


<a> tag → Defines a hyperlink.


href attribute → Specifies the destination URL or file name.


Example:
<a href="about.html">Go to About Page</a>

When clicked, it opens about.html.



🧩 In short:
👉 To link two web pages, use the <a href="page2.html">Link Text</a> tag.

Would you like me to show how to link web pages in different folders (e.g., using relative and absolute paths)? It’s a common next step.                             cc
4)Difference between Get and Post Method
get
* when we have form data when we click on submit button the form data is visibe on the URL
*its is secured
*Takes n numbers of characters in URL
  When you submit a form in HTML, data can be sent to the server using two main methods — GET and POST.

Both are used in the <form> tag’s method attribute:

<form action="submit.php" method="GET">   <!-- or method="POST" -->
  ...
</form>

🔍 1. GET Method

✅ Features:

Sends form data through the URL (visible in the address bar).

Example:
https://example.com/submit.php?name=John&age=20

Used mainly for retrieving data (not for sending sensitive info).

📦 Data Limit: Limited (around 2000 characters).
🔒 Security: Less secure — data visible in URL.
🔁 Can be bookmarked: Yes (since data is in the URL).

🧩 Example:

<form action="search.php" method="GET">
  <input type="text" name="query" placeholder="Search...">
  <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>

🔐 2. POST Method

✅ Features:

Sends form data in the background (HTTP body) — not visible in the URL.

Used for sending or updating data (like registration, login, feedback forms).

📦 Data Limit: No size limit (can send large data).
🔒 Security: More secure than GET (data not shown in address bar).
🔁 Can be bookmarked: No.

🧩 Example:

<form action="register.php" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter username">
  <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter password">
  <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>

5)Create 5*5 Table
✅ HTML Code Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>5x5 Table Example</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h2>5 × 5 Table</h2>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
      <th>Header 3</th>
      <th>Header 4</th>
      <th>Header 5</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 1, Col 1</td>
      <td>Row 1, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 1, Col 3</td>
      <td>Row 1, Col 4</td>
      <td>Row 1, Col 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 2, Col 1</td>
      <td>Row 2, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 2, Col 3</td>
      <td>Row 2, Col 4</td>
      <td>Row 2, Col 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 3, Col 1</td>
      <td>Row 3, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 3, Col 3</td>
      <td>Row 3, Col 4</td>
      <td>Row 3, Col 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 4, Col 1</td>
      <td>Row 4, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 4, Col 3</td>
      <td>Row 4, Col 4</td>
      <td>Row 4, Col 5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 5, Col 1</td>
      <td>Row 5, Col 2</td>
      <td>Row 5, Col 3</td>
      <td>Row 5, Col 4</td>
      <td>Row 5, Col 5</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

</body>
</html>

💡 Explanation

<table> → creates the table

<tr> → defines a table row

<th> → defines a table header cell (bold & centered)

<td> → defines a table data cell
6)How to upload image on web page?
How to Upload (Display) an Image on a Web Page

To show an image on a webpage, we use the <img> tag in HTML.

✅ Basic Syntax
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

🧩 Explanation of Attributes
Attribute	Purpose
src	Specifies the path or URL of the image file.
alt	Provides alternative text (displayed if the image can’t load).
width & height	Used to set image size (in pixels or %).
📸 Example 1 – Image from Same Folder
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Image Example</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h2>My Favorite Picture</h2>
  <img src="flower.jpg" alt="A beautiful flower" width="300" height="200">

</body>
</html>


🗂️ Make sure the image file (flower.jpg) is in the same folder as your HTML file.

🌐 Example 2 – Image from Online URL
<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl Image" width="300">


This displays an image directly from the web using its URL.

🖼️ Example 3 – Image from a Subfolder

If your image is inside an “images” folder:

<img src="images/pic1.jpg" alt="Sample Image">

⚙️ In short:

To display an image → use the <img> tag with the src and alt attributes.

Example:

<img src="photo.jpg" alt="My Photo">
7)Difference b/w anchor tag and form
Let’s clearly understand the difference between the <a> (anchor) tag and the <form> tag in HTML 👇

7️⃣ Difference Between Anchor Tag and Form

Both are used for navigation or interaction — but they serve different purposes.

🔗 1. Anchor Tag (<a>)

✅ Purpose:
Used to create hyperlinks — to link one page, section, or website to another.

🧩 Syntax:

<a href="about.html">Go to About Page</a>


💡 Key Points:

Navigates to another web page or URL.

Uses the href attribute (hyperlink reference).

Does not send data to the server.

Used for simple navigation, like menus or buttons.

📝 2. Form Tag (<form>)

✅ Purpose:
Used to collect user input (like name, email, password) and send it to a server for processing.

🧩 Syntax:

<form action="submit.php" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


💡 Key Points:

Used for collecting and submitting data.

Uses action (target page) and method (GET/POST).

Can contain form elements like <input>, <select>, <textarea>, etc.

Sends data to a server for processing (e.g., login, registration).

📊 Comparison Table
Feature	<a> Tag (Anchor)	<form> Tag
Purpose	Navigates between web pages	Collects and sends user data
Attributes	href, target	action, method
Data Submission	❌ No	✅ Yes
User Input Fields	❌ No	✅ Yes (<input>, <select>, etc.)
Typical Use	Links, menus, navigation	Login, registration, search, feedback
Example	<a href="home.html">Home</a>	<form action="login.php" method="POST">…</form>
🏁 In short:

🔗 Anchor tag (<a>) → Used for navigation (moves between pages).
📝 Form tag (<form>) → Used for data collection and submission to a server.
8)Difference b/w HTML4 and HTML5 
HTML5
*HTML5 we can run in mobile
*All browsers supports HTML5
*Semantic Tags are implemented
*HTML 5 supports JS to run in background
*Media Tags are fully supported in HTML5
HTML4
*HTML4 we cannot run in mobile
*Only limited Browsers supports HTML4
*Semantic Tags are not implemented
*Media Tags are fully supported in HTML5
*HTML 4 not support JS to run  in background
9) write an HTML structure
9️⃣ Basic HTML Structure

Here’s what a complete HTML document looks like 👇

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>

</body>
</html>

🧩 Explanation of Each Part
Part	Description
<!DOCTYPE html>	Tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
<html>	The root element that contains the entire web page.
<head>	Contains information about the page (metadata, title, links, etc.).
<title>	Sets the title of the page (shown in the browser tab).
<body>	Contains the content that appears on the webpage (text, images, links, etc.).
✅ Example Output in Browser

Welcome to My Website!
This is my first HTML page.

🏁 In short:

Every HTML page starts with
<!DOCTYPE html> → <html> → <head> → <body>
and ends with </body> and </html>.
